4, Flash your Jetson TX2 Following the step in SDK Manager
5, Install Digits on your host machine. Follow the step in https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/digits-setup.md
6, Now go to your Jetson Tx2. Open the terminal and type following command.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git cmake libpython3-dev python3-numpy
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference
$ cd jetson-inference
$ mkdir build

10, Click models and new model image classification. Select the dataset you just build and traint the model.
11,Download you model. And deploy it on Jetson TX2. (https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/imagenet-custom.md)
12,Go to Jetson TX2 extract your model to ~/network
13, now go to ~/jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin
14, copy my runcamera.sh to ~/jetson-inference/build/aarch64/bin
15, now run ./runcamera.sh
